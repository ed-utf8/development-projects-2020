## How can I add Advance to my server?

First and foremost, Advance is private. Advance does not support self-hosting, so you cannot run a copy yourself. If you believe that Advance is the only bot that would fulfill your server's needs, you may join the server listed above and contact Kieran#0273 or Ed#8133. Advance is designed to be the core moderation and utility bot for a server, and thus is primarily used by servers with large numbers of members (usually a couple thousand) and without many, if any, other bots.
